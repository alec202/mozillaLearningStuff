    <h1>Squirrels</h1>

    <p>
      Squirrels are commonly thought of as tree-dwelling mammals, but the squirrel
      family extends far beyond that to include ground-dwelling rodents such as
      chipmunks and prairie dogs, and flying squirrels.
    </p>

    <p>Two of the most common and best-known squirrel species are the:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>

          </a>
        </li>
      
      
        <li>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_gray_squirrel" title="Sciurus carolinensis">

          </a>
        </li>
    </ul>
