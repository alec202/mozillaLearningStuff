to use node.js http-server module as an easy way to host html files in any directory:

    npx http-server /path/to/project -o -p 9999

This hosts all files in the /path/to/project directory on localhost:9999. 
The option -o will open the index.html page in a web browser. If index.html doesn't exist, 
then the directory is displayed instead.

The --open flag (or -o with a path) lets you specify which file to open. For example:
    npx http-server /path/to/project -o/myfile.html -p 9999 
will open the html file called myfile.html.
