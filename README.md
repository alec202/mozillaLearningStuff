This repository is where I will store the code examples I complete as I work through the [Mozilla web application development course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started)

I am here: 

First redo challenge 3 and continue from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Test_your_skills/Selectors#task_3

Then, continue from here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model

After Finished with all of the CSS stuff come back here and read this to understand what it does better:
